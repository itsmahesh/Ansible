Apport is Ubuntu built-in crash-reporting framework.<p>

Apport and systemd-coredump are prone to local information disclosure vulnerabilities. The first (CVE-2025-5054) affects apport Ubuntu core-dump handler, and the second (CVE-2025-4598) targets the systemd-coredump, which is the default core-dump handler on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and Fedora. These race conditions allow a local attacker to exploit a SUID program and gain read access to the resulting core dump.</p><p>

Detection Logic (Authenticated):<br />
For systemd-coredump detection checks if systemd-coredump is used in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern; then, if %d is used in there, it is not vulnerable; if %d is not used in there, it is vulnerable. <br />
For apport, first, check if apport is used in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern, this program (typically /usr/share/apport/apport) is written in Python, so, if it contains the

Apport is Ubuntu built-in crash-reporting framework.<p>

Apport and systemd-coredump are prone to local information disclosure vulnerabilities. The first (CVE-2025-5054) affects apport Ubuntu core-dump handler, and the second (CVE-2025-4598) targets the systemd-coredump, which is the default core-dump handler on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and Fedora.

Detection Logic (Authenticated):<br />
For systemd-coredump detection checks if systemd-coredump is used in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern; then, if %d is used in there, it is not vulnerable; if %d is not used in there, it is vulnerable. <br />
For apport, first, check if apport is used in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern, this program (typically /usr/share/apport/apport) is written in Python, so, if it contains the

For systemd-coredump detection checks if systemd-coredump is used in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern; then, if %d is used in there, it is not vulnerable; if %d is not used in there, it is vulnerable. <br />
For apport, first, check if apport is used in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern, this program (typically /usr/share/apport/apport) is written in Python, so, if it contains the

Settings currently considered deprecated:</p><p>

1.Ciphers using CFB or OFB:<br />
These are considered uncommon and deprecated due to vulnerabilities when compared to newer cipher chaining modes such as CTR or GCM.</p><p>
 
2.RC4 cipher (arcfour, arcfour128, arcfour256):<br />
The RC4 cipher is no longer considered secure and exhibits cryptographic bias.</p><p>
 
3.Ciphers with a 64-bit block size (DES, 3DES, Blowfish, IDEA, CAST):<br />
These ciphers may be vulnerable to birthday attacks (Sweet32).</p><p>
 
4.Key exchange algorithms using DH group 1 (diffie-hellman-group1-sha1, gss-group1-sha1-*):<br />
DH group 1 uses a 1024-bit key size, which is considered too short and vulnerable to Logjam-style attacks.</p><p>

5.Key exchange algorithm &#34;rsa1024sha1&#34;:<br />
This algorithm is very uncommon and deprecated due to its short RSA key size.</p><p>

6.MAC algorithm &#34;umac-32&#34;:<br />
This algorithm is extremely uncommon and deprecated due to its very short MAC length.</p><p>

7.Cipher &#34;none&#34;:<br />
This cipher is available only in SSHv1.</p><p>

8.MAC algorithm &#34;MD5&#34;:<br />
All MD5 based mac algorithms are deprecated.</p><p>

9.96-bit MAC:<br />
both sha1 and sha2 variants of 96 bit macs are considered deprecated. </p><p>

"VIT41827468","DC04PLVWBS321","DC04PLVWBS321.WELLPOINT.COM","Web Server HTTP Trace/Track Method Support Cross-Site Tracing Vulnerability","A Web server was detected that supports the HTTP TRACE method. This method allows debugging and connection trace analysis for connections from the client to the Web server. Per the HTTP specification, when this method is used, the Web server echoes back the information sent to it by the client unmodified and unfiltered. Microsoft IIS web server uses an alias TRACK for this method, and is functionally the same.
<p>
A vulnerability related to this method was discovered. A malicious, active component in a Web page can send Trace requests to a Web server that supports this Trace method. Usually, browser security disallows access to Web sites outside of the present site&#39;s domain. Although unlikely and difficult to achieve, it&#39;s possible, in the presence of other browser vulnerabilities, for the active HTML content to make external requests to arbitrary Web servers beyond the hosting Web server. Since the chosen Web server then echoes back the client request unfiltered, the response also includes cookie-based or Web-based (if logged on) authentication credentials that the browser automatically sent to the specified Web application on the specified Web server. 
</p><p>
The significance of the Trace capability in this vulnerability is that the active component in the page visited by the victim user has no direct access to this authentication information, but gets it after the target Web server echoes it back as its Trace response. 
</p><p>
Since this vulnerability exists as a support for a method required by the HTTP protocol specification, most common Web servers are vulnerable.
</p><p>
The exact method(s) supported, Trace and/or Track, and their responses are in the Results section below.
</p><p>
Track / Trace are required to be disabled to be PCI compliance. </p>","Solutions for some of the common Web servers are supplied below. For other Web servers, please check your vendor&#39;s documentation.
<p>
<b>Apache</b>: Recent Apache versions have a Rewrite module that allows HTTP requests to be rewritten or handled in a specific way. Compile the Apache server with the mod_rewrite module. You might need to uncomment the &#39;AddModule&#39; and &#39;LoadModule&#39; directives in the httpd.conf configuration file. Add the following lines for each virtualhost in your configuration file (Please note that, by default, Rewrite configurations are not inherited. This means that you need to have Rewrite directives for each virtual host in which you wish to use it):
</p><pre>
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^TRACE
RewriteRule .* - [F]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
With this configuration, Apache catches all TRACE requests, and replies with a page reporting the request as forbidden. None of the original request&#39;s contents are echoed back.
<p>
A slightly tighter fix is to use:
</p><pre>
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !^(GET|POST|HEAD)$
RewriteRule .* - [F]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>

<p>Please note that RewriteEngine can be processor intensive and may impact the web server performance. The trace method can also be controlled by use of the TraceEnable directive.
<br />In the httpd.conf add or modify:
</p><p>
TraceEnable Off
</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>Microsoft IIS</b>: Microsoft released <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307608"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">URLScan</a>, which can be used to screen all incoming requests based on customized rulesets. URLScan can be used to sanitize or disable the TRACE requests from the clients. Note that IIS aliases &#39;TRACK&#39; to &#39;TRACE&#39;. Therefore, if URLScan is used to specfically block the TRACE method, the TRACK method should also be added to the filter.
</p><p>
URLScan uses the &#39;urlscan.ini&#39; configuration file, usually in \System32\InetSrv\URLScan directory. In that, we have two sections - AllowVerbs and DenyVerbs. The former is used if the UseAllowVerbs variable is set to 1, else (if its set to 0), the DenyVerbs are used. Clearly, either can be used, depending on whether we want a Default-Deny-Explicit-Allow or a Default-Allow-Explicit-Deny policy. To disallow TRACE and TRACK methods through URLScan, first remove &#39;TRACK&#39;, &#39;TRACE&#39; methods from the &#39;AllowVerbs&#39; section and add them to the &#39;DenyVerbs&#39; section. With this, URLScan will disallow all &#39;TRACE&#39; and &#39;TRACK&#39; methods, and generate an error page for all requests using that method. To enable the changes, restart the &#39;World Wide Web Publishing Service&#39; from the &#39;Services&#39; Control Panel item.</p><p>

"VIT65185901","DC04PLVWBS322","DC04PLVWBS322.WELLPOINT.COM","Web Server HTTP Trace/Track Method Support Cross-Site Tracing Vulnerability","A Web server was detected that supports the HTTP TRACE method. This method allows debugging and connection trace analysis for connections from the client to the Web server. Per the HTTP specification, when this method is used, the Web server echoes back the information sent to it by the client unmodified and unfiltered. Microsoft IIS web server uses an alias TRACK for this method, and is functionally the same.
<p>
A vulnerability related to this method was discovered. A malicious, active component in a Web page can send Trace requests to a Web server that supports this Trace method. Usually, browser security disallows access to Web sites outside of the present site&#39;s domain. Although unlikely and difficult to achieve, it&#39;s possible, in the presence of other browser vulnerabilities, for the active HTML content to make external requests to arbitrary Web servers beyond the hosting Web server. Since the chosen Web server then echoes back the client request unfiltered, the response also includes cookie-based or Web-based (if logged on) authentication credentials that the browser automatically sent to the specified Web application on the specified Web server. 
</p><p>
The significance of the Trace capability in this vulnerability is that the active component in the page visited by the victim user has no direct access to this authentication information, but gets it after the target Web server echoes it back as its Trace response. 
</p><p>
Since this vulnerability exists as a support for a method required by the HTTP protocol specification, most common Web servers are vulnerable.
</p><p>
The exact method(s) supported, Trace and/or Track, and their responses are in the Results section below.
</p><p>
Track / Trace are required to be disabled to be PCI compliance. </p>","Solutions for some of the common Web servers are supplied below. For other Web servers, please check your vendor&#39;s documentation.
<p>
<b>Apache</b>: Recent Apache versions have a Rewrite module that allows HTTP requests to be rewritten or handled in a specific way. Compile the Apache server with the mod_rewrite module. You might need to uncomment the &#39;AddModule&#39; and &#39;LoadModule&#39; directives in the httpd.conf configuration file. Add the following lines for each virtualhost in your configuration file (Please note that, by default, Rewrite configurations are not inherited. This means that you need to have Rewrite directives for each virtual host in which you wish to use it):
</p><pre>
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^TRACE
RewriteRule .* - [F]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
With this configuration, Apache catches all TRACE requests, and replies with a page reporting the request as forbidden. None of the original request&#39;s contents are echoed back.
<p>
A slightly tighter fix is to use:
</p><pre>
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !^(GET|POST|HEAD)$
RewriteRule .* - [F]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>

<p>Please note that RewriteEngine can be processor intensive and may impact the web server performance. The trace method can also be controlled by use of the TraceEnable directive.
<br />In the httpd.conf add or modify:
</p><p>
TraceEnable Off
</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>Microsoft IIS</b>: Microsoft released <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307608"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">URLScan</a>, which can be used to screen all incoming requests based on customized rulesets. URLScan can be used to sanitize or disable the TRACE requests from the clients. Note that IIS aliases &#39;TRACK&#39; to &#39;TRACE&#39;. Therefore, if URLScan is used to specfically block the TRACE method, the TRACK method should also be added to the filter.
</p><p>
URLScan uses the &#39;urlscan.ini&#39; configuration file, usually in \System32\InetSrv\URLScan directory. In that, we have two sections - AllowVerbs and DenyVerbs. The former is used if the UseAllowVerbs variable is set to 1, else (if its set to 0), the DenyVerbs are used. Clearly, either can be used, depending on whether we want a Default-Deny-Explicit-Allow or a Default-Allow-Explicit-Deny policy. To disallow TRACE and TRACK methods through URLScan, first remove &#39;TRACK&#39;, &#39;TRACE&#39; methods from the &#39;AllowVerbs&#39; section and add them to the &#39;DenyVerbs&#39; section. With this, URLScan will disallow all &#39;TRACE&#39; and &#39;TRACK&#39; methods, and generate an error page for all requests using that method. To enable the changes, restart the &#39;World Wide Web Publishing Service&#39; from the &#39;Services&#39; Control Panel item.</p><p>

1.Ciphers using CFB or OFB:<br />
These are considered uncommon and deprecated due to vulnerabilities when compared to newer cipher chaining modes such as CTR or GCM.</p><p>
 
2.RC4 cipher (arcfour, arcfour128, arcfour256):<br />
The RC4 cipher is no longer considered secure and exhibits cryptographic bias.</p><p>
 
3.Ciphers with a 64-bit block size (DES, 3DES, Blowfish, IDEA, CAST):<br />
These ciphers may be vulnerable to birthday attacks (Sweet32).</p><p>
 
4.Key exchange algorithms using DH group 1 (diffie-hellman-group1-sha1, gss-group1-sha1-*):<br />

For a SSL enabled port, the scanner probes and maintains a list of supported SSL/TLS versions.

The SSL/TLS server supports key exchanges that are cryptographically weaker than recommended.

X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header will prevent the browser from interpreting files as a different MIME type to what is specified in the Content-Type HTTP header. <br />
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) allows web servers to declare that web browsers (or other complying user agents) should only interact with it using secure HTTPS connections, and never via the insecure HTTP protocol.<p>

</p><p>QID Detection Logic:<br />
This unauthenticated QID will send a GET request sent to &#39;/&#39; (default) endpoint and looks for the presence of the following HTTP Headers in the received response:<br />
The Valid directives are as belows:
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</p><p>
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age&#61;&lt; [;includeSubDomains]</p><p>
</p>","<b>Note:</b> To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose.<p>
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A &#34;missing&#34; protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An &#34;insufficient&#34; protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an &#34;ignored&#34; mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.</p><p>
Customers are advised to set proper <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">X-Content-Type-Options</a> and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">Strict-Transport-Security</a> HTTP response headers.</p><p>
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are:</p><p>
X-Content-Type-Options:<br />
Apache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</p><p>
HTTP Strict-Transport-Security:<br />
Apache: Header always set Strict-Transport-Security &#34;max-age&#61;31536000; includeSubDomains&#34;<br />
Nginx: add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age&#61;31536000;</p><p>

CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A &#34;missing&#34; protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An &#34;insufficient&#34; protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an &#34;ignored&#34; mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.</p><p>

Since the chosen Web server then echoes back the client request unfiltered, the response also includes cookie-based or Web-based (if logged on) authentication credentials that the browser automatically sent to the specified Web application on the specified Web server. 
</p><p>
The significance of the Trace capability in this vulnerability is that the active component in the page visited by the victim user has no direct access to this authentication information, but gets it after the target Web server echoes it back as its Trace response. 
</p><p>
Since this vulnerability exists as a support for a method required by the HTTP protocol specification, most common Web servers are vulnerable.
</p><p>
The exact method(s) supported, Trace and/or Track, and their responses are in the Results section below.
</p><p>
Track / Trace are required to be disabled to be PCI compliance. </p>","Solutions for some of the common Web servers are supplied below. For other Web servers, please check your vendor&#39;s documentation.
<p>
<b>Apache</b>: Recent Apache versions have a Rewrite module that allows HTTP requests to be rewritten or handled in a specific way. Compile the Apache server with the mod_rewrite module. You might need to uncomment the &#39;AddModule&#39; and &#39;LoadModule&#39; directives in the httpd.conf configuration file. Add the following lines for each virtualhost in your configuration file (Please note that, by default, Rewrite configurations are not inherited. This means that you need to have Rewrite directives for each virtual host in which you wish to use it):
</p><pre>
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^TRACE
RewriteRule .* - [F]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
With this configuration, Apache catches all TRACE requests, and replies with a page reporting the request as forbidden. None of the original request&#39;s contents are echoed back.
<p>
A slightly tighter fix is to use:
</p><pre>
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !^(GET|POST|HEAD)$
RewriteRule .* - [F]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>

<p>Please note that RewriteEngine can be processor intensive and may impact the web server performance. The trace method can also be controlled by use of the TraceEnable directive.
<br />In the httpd.conf add or modify:
</p><p>
TraceEnable Off
</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>Microsoft IIS</b>: Microsoft released <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307608"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">URLScan</a>, which can be used to screen all incoming requests based on customized rulesets. URLScan can be used to sanitize or disable the TRACE requests from the clients. Note that IIS aliases &#39;TRACK&#39; to &#39;TRACE&#39;. Therefore, if URLScan is used to specfically block the TRACE method, the TRACK method should also be added to the filter.
</p><p>
URLScan uses the &#39;urlscan.ini&#39; configuration file, usually in \System32\InetSrv\URLScan directory. In that, we have two sections - AllowVerbs and DenyVerbs. The former is used if the UseAllowVerbs variable is set to 1, else (if its set to 0), the DenyVerbs are used. Clearly, either can be used, depending on whether we want a Default-Deny-Explicit-Allow or a Default-Allow-Explicit-Deny policy. To disallow TRACE and TRACK methods through URLScan, first remove &#39;TRACK&#39;, &#39;TRACE&#39; methods from the &#39;AllowVerbs&#39; section and add them to the &#39;DenyVerbs&#39; section. With this, URLScan will disallow all &#39;TRACE&#39; and &#39;TRACK&#39; methods, and generate an error page for all requests using that method. To enable the changes, restart the &#39;World Wide Web Publishing Service&#39; from the &#39;Services&#39; Control Panel item.</p><p>

Apport is Ubuntu built-in crash-reporting framework.<p>

Apport and systemd-coredump are prone to local information disclosure vulnerabilities. The first (CVE-2025-5054) affects apport Ubuntu core-dump handler, and the second (CVE-2025-4598) targets the systemd-coredump, which is the default core-dump handler on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and Fedora. These race conditions allow a local attacker to exploit a SUID program and gain read access to the resulting core dump.</p><p>

Detection Logic (Authenticated):<br />
For systemd-coredump detection checks if systemd-coredump is used in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern; then, if %d is used in there, it is not vulnerable; if %d is not used in there, it is vulnerable. <br />
For apport, first, check if apport is used in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern, this program (typically /usr/share/apport/apport) is written in Python, so, if it contains the
string &#34;_check_global_pid_and_forward&#34; AND the string &#34;options.pid &#61; options.global_pid&#34; then it is vulnerable, otherwise it is not vulnerable.<br /></p>","Customers are advised to refer following articles for more information on the vulnerabilities and patches.<br />

X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header will prevent the browser from interpreting files as a different MIME type to what is specified in the Content-Type HTTP header. <br />
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) allows web servers to declare that web browsers (or other complying user agents) should only interact with it using secure HTTPS connections, and never via the insecure HTTP protocol.<p>

</p><p>QID Detection Logic:<br />
This unauthenticated QID will send a GET request sent to &#39;/&#39; (default) endpoint and looks for the presence of the following HTTP Headers in the received response:<br />
The Valid directives are as belows:
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</p><p>
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age&#61;&lt; [;includeSubDomains]</p><p>
</p>","<b>Note:</b> To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose.<p>
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A &#34;missing&#34; protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An &#34;insufficient&#34; protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an &#34;ignored&#34; mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.</p><p>
Customers are advised to set proper <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">X-Content-Type-Options</a> and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">Strict-Transport-Security</a> HTTP response headers.</p><p>
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are:</p><p>
X-Content-Type-Options:<br />
Apache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</p><p>
HTTP Strict-Transport-Security:<br />
Apache: Header always set Strict-Transport-Security &#34;max-age&#61;31536000; includeSubDomains&#34;<br />
Nginx: add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age&#61;31536000;</p><p>
<b>Note: Network devices that include a HTTP/HTTPS console for administrative/management purposes often do not include all/some of the security headers.

X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header will prevent the browser from interpreting files as a different MIME type to what is specified in the Content-Type HTTP header. <br />
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) allows web servers to declare that web browsers (or other complying user agents) should only interact with it using secure HTTPS connections, and never via the insecure HTTP protocol.<p>

</p><p>QID Detection Logic:<br />
This unauthenticated QID will send a GET request sent to &#39;/&#39; (default) endpoint and looks for the presence of the following HTTP Headers in the received response:<br />
The Valid directives are as belows:
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</p><p>
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age&#61;&lt; [;includeSubDomains]</p><p>
</p>","<b>Note:</b> To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose.<p>
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A &#34;missing&#34; protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An &#34;insufficient&#34; protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an &#34;ignored&#34; mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.</p><p>
Customers are advised to set proper <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">X-Content-Type-Options</a> and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">Strict-Transport-Security</a> HTTP response headers.</p><p>
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are:</p><p>
X-Content-Type-Options:<br />
Apache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</p><p>
HTTP Strict-Transport-Security:<br />
Apache: Header always set Strict-Transport-Security &#34;max-age&#61;31536000; includeSubDomains&#34;<br />
Nginx: add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age&#61;31536000;</p><p>

CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A &#34;missing&#34; protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An &#34;insufficient&#34; protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an &#34;ignored&#34; mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.</p><p>

"VIT52184186","DC04TLVWBS428","DC04TLVWBS428.WELLPOINT.COM","Web Server HTTP Trace/Track Method Support Cross-Site Tracing Vulnerability","A Web server was detected that supports the HTTP TRACE method. This method allows debugging and connection trace analysis for connections from the client to the Web server. Per the HTTP specification, when this method is used, the Web server echoes back the information sent to it by the client unmodified and unfiltered. Microsoft IIS web server uses an alias TRACK for this method, and is functionally the same.
<p>
A vulnerability related to this method was discovered. A malicious, active component in a Web page can send Trace requests to a Web server that supports this Trace method. Usually, browser security disallows access to Web sites outside of the present site&#39;s domain. Although unlikely and difficult to achieve, it&#39;s possible, in the presence of other browser vulnerabilities, for the active HTML content to make external requests to arbitrary Web servers beyond the hosting Web server. Since the chosen Web server then echoes back the client request unfiltered, the response also includes cookie-based or Web-based (if logged on) authentication credentials that the browser automatically sent to the specified Web application on the specified Web server. 
</p><p>
The significance of the Trace capability in this vulnerability is that the active component in the page visited by the victim user has no direct access to this authentication information, but gets it after the target Web server echoes it back as its Trace response. 
</p><p>
Since this vulnerability exists as a support for a method required by the HTTP protocol specification, most common Web servers are vulnerable.
</p><p>
The exact method(s) supported, Trace and/or Track, and their responses are in the Results section below.
</p><p>
Track / Trace are required to be disabled to be PCI compliance. </p>","Solutions for some of the common Web servers are supplied below. For other Web servers, please check your vendor&#39;s documentation.
<p>
<b>Apache</b>: Recent Apache versions have a Rewrite module that allows HTTP requests to be rewritten or handled in a specific way. Compile the Apache server with the mod_rewrite module. You might need to uncomment the &#39;AddModule&#39; and &#39;LoadModule&#39; directives in the httpd.conf configuration file. Add the following lines for each virtualhost in your configuration file (Please note that, by default, Rewrite configurations are not inherited. This means that you need to have Rewrite directives for each virtual host in which you wish to use it):
</p><pre>
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^TRACE
RewriteRule .* - [F]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
With this configuration, Apache catches all TRACE requests, and replies with a page reporting the request as forbidden. None of the original request&#39;s contents are echoed back.
<p>
A slightly tighter fix is to use:
</p><pre>
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !^(GET|POST|HEAD)$
RewriteRule .* - [F]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>

<p>Please note that RewriteEngine can be processor intensive and may impact the web server performance. The trace method can also be controlled by use of the TraceEnable directive.
<br />In the httpd.conf add or modify:
</p><p>
TraceEnable Off
</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>Microsoft IIS</b>: Microsoft released <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307608"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">URLScan</a>, which can be used to screen all incoming requests based on customized rulesets. URLScan can be used to sanitize or disable the TRACE requests from the clients. Note that IIS aliases &#39;TRACK&#39; to &#39;TRACE&#39;. Therefore, if URLScan is used to specfically block the TRACE method, the TRACK method should also be added to the filter.
</p><p>
URLScan uses the &#39;urlscan.ini&#39; configuration file, usually in \System32\InetSrv\URLScan directory. In that, we have two sections - AllowVerbs and DenyVerbs. The former is used if the UseAllowVerbs variable is set to 1, else (if its set to 0), the DenyVerbs are used. Clearly, either can be used, depending on whether we want a Default-Deny-Explicit-Allow or a Default-Allow-Explicit-Deny policy. To disallow TRACE and TRACK methods through URLScan, first remove &#39;TRACK&#39;, &#39;TRACE&#39; methods from the &#39;AllowVerbs&#39; section and add them to the &#39;DenyVerbs&#39; section. With this, URLScan will disallow all &#39;TRACE&#39; and &#39;TRACK&#39; methods, and generate an error page for all requests using that method. To enable the changes, restart the &#39;World Wide Web Publishing Service&#39; from the &#39;Services&#39; Control Panel item.</p><p>

CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A &#34;missing&#34; protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An &#34;insufficient&#34; protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an &#34;ignored&#34; mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.</p><p>

"VIT52184179","DC04TLVWBS427","DC04TLVWBS427.WELLPOINT.COM","Web Server HTTP Trace/Track Method Support Cross-Site Tracing Vulnerability","A Web server was detected that supports the HTTP TRACE method. This method allows debugging and connection trace analysis for connections from the client to the Web server. Per the HTTP specification, when this method is used, the Web server echoes back the information sent to it by the client unmodified and unfiltered. Microsoft IIS web server uses an alias TRACK for this method, and is functionally the same.
<p>
A vulnerability related to this method was discovered. A malicious, active component in a Web page can send Trace requests to a Web server that supports this Trace method. Usually, browser security disallows access to Web sites outside of the present site&#39;s domain. Although unlikely and difficult to achieve, it&#39;s possible, in the presence of other browser vulnerabilities, for the active HTML content to make external requests to arbitrary Web servers beyond the hosting Web server. Since the chosen Web server then echoes back the client request unfiltered, the response also includes cookie-based or Web-based (if logged on) authentication credentials that the browser automatically sent to the specified Web application on the specified Web server. 
</p><p>
The significance of the Trace capability in this vulnerability is that the active component in the page visited by the victim user has no direct access to this authentication information, but gets it after the target Web server echoes it back as its Trace response. 
</p><p>
Since this vulnerability exists as a support for a method required by the HTTP protocol specification, most common Web servers are vulnerable.
</p><p>
The exact method(s) supported, Trace and/or Track, and their responses are in the Results section below.
</p><p>
Track / Trace are required to be disabled to be PCI compliance. </p>","Solutions for some of the common Web servers are supplied below. For other Web servers, please check your vendor&#39;s documentation.
<p>
<b>Apache</b>: Recent Apache versions have a Rewrite module that allows HTTP requests to be rewritten or handled in a specific way. Compile the Apache server with the mod_rewrite module. You might need to uncomment the &#39;AddModule&#39; and &#39;LoadModule&#39; directives in the httpd.conf configuration file. Add the following lines for each virtualhost in your configuration file (Please note that, by default, Rewrite configurations are not inherited. This means that you need to have Rewrite directives for each virtual host in which you wish to use it):
</p><pre>
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^TRACE
RewriteRule .* - [F]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
With this configuration, Apache catches all TRACE requests, and replies with a page reporting the request as forbidden. None of the original request&#39;s contents are echoed back.
<p>
A slightly tighter fix is to use:
</p><pre>
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !^(GET|POST|HEAD)$
RewriteRule .* - [F]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>

<p>Please note that RewriteEngine can be processor intensive and may impact the web server performance. The trace method can also be controlled by use of the TraceEnable directive.
<br />In the httpd.conf add or modify:
</p><p>
TraceEnable Off
</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>Microsoft IIS</b>: Microsoft released <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307608"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">URLScan</a>, which can be used to screen all incoming requests based on customized rulesets. URLScan can be used to sanitize or disable the TRACE requests from the clients. Note that IIS aliases &#39;TRACK&#39; to &#39;TRACE&#39;. Therefore, if URLScan is used to specfically block the TRACE method, the TRACK method should also be added to the filter.
</p><p>
URLScan uses the &#39;urlscan.ini&#39; configuration file, usually in \System32\InetSrv\URLScan directory. In that, we have two sections - AllowVerbs and DenyVerbs. The former is used if the UseAllowVerbs variable is set to 1, else (if its set to 0), the DenyVerbs are used. Clearly, either can be used, depending on whether we want a Default-Deny-Explicit-Allow or a Default-Allow-Explicit-Deny policy. To disallow TRACE and TRACK methods through URLScan, first remove &#39;TRACK&#39;, &#39;TRACE&#39; methods from the &#39;AllowVerbs&#39; section and add them to the &#39;DenyVerbs&#39; section. With this, URLScan will disallow all &#39;TRACE&#39; and &#39;TRACK&#39; methods, and generate an error page for all requests using that method. To enable the changes, restart the &#39;World Wide Web Publishing Service&#39; from the &#39;Services&#39; Control Panel item.</p><p>

An &#34;insufficient&#34; protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an &#34;ignored&#34; mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.</p><p>

X-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header will prevent the browser from interpreting files as a different MIME type to what is specified in the Content-Type HTTP header. <br />
Strict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) allows web servers to declare that web browsers (or other complying user agents) should only interact with it using secure HTTPS connections, and never via the insecure HTTP protocol.<p>

</p><p>QID Detection Logic:<br />
This unauthenticated QID will send a GET request sent to &#39;/&#39; (default) endpoint and looks for the presence of the following HTTP Headers in the received response:<br />
The Valid directives are as belows:
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</p><p>
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age&#61;&lt; [;includeSubDomains]</p><p>
</p>","<b>Note:</b> To better debug the results of this QID, it is requested that customers execute commands to simulate the following functionality: curl -lkL --verbose.<p>
CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A &#34;missing&#34; protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An &#34;insufficient&#34; protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an &#34;ignored&#34; mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.</p><p>
Customers are advised to set proper <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">X-Content-Type-Options</a> and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">Strict-Transport-Security</a> HTTP response headers.</p><p>
Depending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are:</p><p>
X-Content-Type-Options:<br />
Apache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</p><p>
HTTP Strict-Transport-Security:<br />

Apport is Ubuntu built-in crash-reporting framework.<p>

Apport and systemd-coredump are prone to local information disclosure vulnerabilities. The first (CVE-2025-5054) affects apport Ubuntu core-dump handler, and the second (CVE-2025-4598) targets the systemd-coredump, which is the default core-dump handler on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and Fedora. These race conditions allow a local attacker to exploit a SUID program and gain read access to the resulting core dump.</p><p>

Detection Logic (Authenticated):<br />
For systemd-coredump detection checks if systemd-coredump is used in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern; then, if %d is used in there, it is not vulnerable; if %d is not used in there, it is vulnerable. <br />
For apport, first, check if apport is used in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern, this program (typically /usr/share/apport/apport) is written in Python, so, if it contains the
string &#34;_check_global_pid_and_forward&#34; AND the string &#34;options.pid &#61; options.global_pid&#34; then it is vulnerable, otherwise it is not vulnerable.<br /></p>","Customers are advised to refer following articles for more information on the vulnerabilities and patches.<br />

Apport is Ubuntu built-in crash-reporting framework.<p>

Apport and systemd-coredump are prone to local information disclosure vulnerabilities. The first (CVE-2025-5054) affects apport Ubuntu core-dump handler, and the second (CVE-2025-4598) targets the systemd-coredump, which is the default core-dump handler on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and Fedora. These race conditions allow a local attacker to exploit a SUID program and gain read access to the resulting core dump.</p><p>

Detection Logic (Authenticated):<br />
For systemd-coredump detection checks if systemd-coredump is used in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern; then, if %d is used in there, it is not vulnerable; if %d is not used in there, it is vulnerable. <br />
For apport, first, check if apport is used in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern, this program (typically /usr/share/apport/apport) is written in Python, so, if it contains the
string &#34;_check_global_pid_and_forward&#34; AND the string &#34;options.pid &#61; options.global_pid&#34; then it is vulnerable, otherwise it is not vulnerable.<br /></p>","Customers are advised to refer following articles for more information on the vulnerabilities and patches.<br />

This method allows debugging and connection trace analysis for connections from the client to the Web server. Per the HTTP specification, when this method is used, the Web server echoes back the information sent to it by the client unmodified and unfiltered. Microsoft IIS web server uses an alias TRACK for this method, and is functionally the same.
<p>
A vulnerability related to this method was discovered. A malicious, active component in a Web page can send Trace requests to a Web server that supports this Trace method. Usually, browser security disallows access to Web sites outside of the present site&#39;s domain. Although unlikely and difficult to achieve, it&#39;s possible, in the presence of other browser vulnerabilities, for the active HTML content to make external requests to arbitrary Web servers beyond the hosting Web server. Since the chosen Web server then echoes back the client request unfiltered, the response also includes cookie-based or Web-based (if logged on) authentication credentials that the browser automatically sent to the specified Web application on the specified Web server. 
</p><p>
The significance of the Trace capability in this vulnerability is that the active component in the page visited by the victim user has no direct access to this authentication information, but gets it after the target Web server echoes it back as its Trace response. 
</p><p>
Since this vulnerability exists as a support for a method required by the HTTP protocol specification, most common Web servers are vulnerable.
</p><p>
The exact method(s) supported, Trace and/or Track, and their responses are in the Results section below.
</p><p>
Track / Trace are required to be disabled to be PCI compliance. </p>","Solutions for some of the common Web servers are supplied below. For other Web servers, please check your vendor&#39;s documentation.
<p>
<b>Apache</b>: Recent Apache versions have a Rewrite module that allows HTTP requests to be rewritten or handled in a specific way. Compile the Apache server with the mod_rewrite module. You might need to uncomment the &#39;AddModule&#39; and &#39;LoadModule&#39; directives in the httpd.conf configuration file. Add the following lines for each virtualhost in your configuration file (Please note that, by default, Rewrite configurations are not inherited. This means that you need to have Rewrite directives for each virtual host in which you wish to use it):
</p><pre>
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^TRACE
RewriteRule .* - [F]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
With this configuration, Apache catches all TRACE requests, and replies with a page reporting the request as forbidden. None of the original request&#39;s contents are echoed back.
<p>
A slightly tighter fix is to use:
</p><pre>
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !^(GET|POST|HEAD)$
RewriteRule .* - [F]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>

<p>Please note that RewriteEngine can be processor intensive and may impact the web server performance. The trace method can also be controlled by use of the TraceEnable directive.
<br />In the httpd.conf add or modify:
</p><p>
TraceEnable Off
</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>Microsoft IIS</b>: Microsoft released <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307608"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">URLScan</a>, which can be used to screen all incoming requests based on customized rulesets. URLScan can be used to sanitize or disable the TRACE requests from the clients. Note that IIS aliases &#39;TRACK&#39; to &#39;TRACE&#39;. Therefore, if URLScan is used to specfically block the TRACE method, the TRACK method should also be added to the filter.
</p><p>
URLScan uses the &#39;urlscan.ini&#39; configuration file, usually in \System32\InetSrv\URLScan directory. In that, we have two sections - AllowVerbs and DenyVerbs. The former is used if the UseAllowVerbs variable is set to 1, else (if its set to 0), the DenyVerbs are used. Clearly, either can be used, depending on whether we want a Default-Deny-Explicit-Allow or a Default-Allow-Explicit-Deny policy. To disallow TRACE and TRACK methods through URLScan, first remove &#39;TRACK&#39;, &#39;TRACE&#39; methods from the &#39;AllowVerbs&#39; section and add them to the &#39;DenyVerbs&#39; section. With this, URLScan will disallow all &#39;TRACE&#39; and &#39;TRACK&#39; methods, and generate an error page for all requests using that method. To enable the changes, restart the &#39;World Wide Web Publishing Service&#39; from the &#39;Services&#39; Control Panel item.</p><p>

Apport is Ubuntu built-in crash-reporting framework.<p>

Apport and systemd-coredump are prone to local information disclosure vulnerabilities. The first (CVE-2025-5054) affects apport Ubuntu core-dump handler, and the second (CVE-2025-4598) targets the systemd-coredump, which is the default core-dump handler on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and Fedora. These race conditions allow a local attacker to exploit a SUID program and gain read access to the resulting core dump.</p><p>

Detection Logic (Authenticated):<br />

For apport, first, check if apport is used in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern, this program (typically /usr/share/apport/apport) is written in Python, so, if it contains the
